## About
Graveyard Frenzy is a rhythm game based on Muse Dash, Friday Night Funkin' and OSU!Mania. It was first developed as a college project, in which we had to make a GCD (Game Concept Document) using a random name generator. The name we got was "Frenesi do Cemitério Mundial" (World cemetery frenzy in English).

The prototype version was made using HaxeFlixel and its repository can be found [here](https://github.com/F3rnDev/Frenesi-do-Cemiterio-Mundial)

We're still in a prototype phase, but we're working hard to make it a full game. If you're interested in seeing the progress, you can check our roadmap [here](https://f3rndev.github.io/GraveyardFrenzy/#/roadmap).
